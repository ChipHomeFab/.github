## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Given everything that's happening in the world right now, it feels like the time has come for cheap, decentralized production of semiconductors.

This project aims to get together the craziest minds and (at least) try to make the world a better place.

The goal of the project is coming up with a cheap solution for Si chip fabrication in a device that can be safely operated at home. We are not looking for throughput, just for a way to create decent Si chips and electronic parts at home without depeding on huge, monstruous facilities that mass-produce these goods and that start causing trouble that grows along proportionally with their size.

This project is split into multiple stages and domains that require expertise from all imaginable fields and from all over the world.

Here's a quick rundown on the categories determined and targeted (for now):
